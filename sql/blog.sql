The Federation\'s gone; the Borg is everywhere! You bet I\'m agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I\'d like to think that I haven\'t changed those things, sir. We have a saboteur aboard. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? How long can two people talk about nothing? They were just sucked into space. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I can\'t. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Worf, It\'s better than music. It\'s jazz. and attack the Romulans. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.'),
